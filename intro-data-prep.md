### Pandas

Pandas allows us to deal with data in a way that us humans can understand it - with labelled columns and indexes. It allows us to effortlessly import data from files such as CSVs, allows us to quickly apply complex transformations and filters to our data and much more. Along with Numpy and Matplotlib, it helps create a really strong base for data exploration and analysis in Python. 

``` python
import pandas as pd 
```

#### Data Types

Pandas is based around two data types, the series and the dataframe. A series is a one-dimensional data type where each element is labelled. A dataframe is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure. The Pandas dataframe can store many different data types and each axis is labelled.
